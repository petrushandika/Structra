## 🎯 What is Structra?

Structra is **not a designer**.  
Structra is **not a code generator**.  
**Structra is a UI Structure Engineering Engine.**

Structra treats every design input as an **engineering problem**, not just a visual conversion. It focuses on:

- **Structure** — Logical component and layout organization
- **Hierarchy** — Clear and structured visual hierarchy
- **Maintainability** — Code that's easy to maintain and modify
- **Explainability** — Every decision can be explained and justified
- **Scalability** — Architecture that can grow with needs

## 📖 Reading Guide

### For Developers
- Start with [01 Core Objective](01%20Core%20Objective.md) and [02 MVP](02%20MVP.md)
- Review [03 Canonical Schema](03%20Canonical%20Schema.md) to understand the output format
- Check [11 Getting Started](11%20Getting%20Started.md) for implementation
- Reference [10 API Documentation](10%20API%20Documentation.md) for integration

### For AI Engineers
- Study [04 AI Roles](04%20AI%20Roles.md) for role-based reasoning
- Review [13 Prompt Templates](13%20Prompt%20Templates.md) for prompt engineering
- Understand [06 Ambiguity Handling](06%20Ambiguity%20Handling.md) for error management
- Check [05 Quality Assessment](05%20Quality%20Assessment.md) for quality metrics

### For System Architects
- Read [09 Architecture](09%20Architecture.md) for system design

## 🔗 Key Concepts

### Canonical Output Schema
The **single source of truth** for all AI processes. Every analysis must produce this schema before code generation. See [03 Canonical Schema](03%20Canonical%20Schema.md).

### Role-Based Reasoning
Internal AI roles that ensure quality and consistency:
- **Analyzer** — Observes and identifies
- **Layout Engineer** — Makes structural decisions
- **Code Generator** — Implements code

Learn more in [04 AI Roles](04%20AI%20Roles.md).

### Quality Assessment
Every non-trivial output must include quality assessment covering:
- Visual Confidence
- Structural Confidence
- Responsive Risk
- Maintainability Risk
- Manual Adjustment Needed

Details in [05 Quality Assessment](05%20Quality%20Assessment.md).
