# 🎯 Structra — Core Objective & Philosophy

This document defines the **core objective and engineering philosophy** of Structra.

---

## 🎯 Core Objective

> Transform visual designs and textual intent into
> **consistent, maintainable, scalable, and explainable frontend structures**.

Structra treats every design input as an **engineering problem**, not just a visual conversion.

---

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

> Structra is not a designer.  
> Structra is not a code generator.  
> **Structra is a UI Structure Engineering Engine.**

Decisions must be:

* **Explainable** — Every technical decision has a clear reason
* **Maintainable** — Code is easy to understand and modify by developers
* **Scalable** — Structure supports growth and change

---

## 🚀 Final Directive

> Treat every design as a system.
>
> Focus on:
>
> * **Structure** — Logical component and layout organization
> * **Hierarchy** — Clear and structured visual hierarchy
> * **Maintainability** — Code that's easy to maintain and modify
> * **Explainability** — Every decision can be explained and justified
> * **Scalability** — Architecture that can grow with needs
