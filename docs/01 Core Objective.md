# 🎯 Structra — Core Objective & Philosophy

This document defines the **core objective and engineering philosophy** of Structra.

---

## 🎯 Core Objective

> Transform visual designs, textual intent, and existing code into
> **consistent, maintainable, scalable, and explainable frontend structures**.

Structra is an **AI CSS Editor & Generator** that treats every design input as an **engineering problem**, not just a visual conversion. It supports multiple input modes including visual designs, code input (Bootstrap, Tailwind, CSS manual, SCSS, and other frameworks), and provides comprehensive collection management for organizing and reusing generated CSS.

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

> Structra is not a designer.  
> Structra is not a code generator.  
> **Structra is an AI CSS Editor & Generator — a UI Structure Engineering Engine.**

Decisions must be:

* **Explainable** — Every technical decision has a clear reason
* **Maintainable** — Code is easy to understand and modify by developers
* **Scalable** — Structure supports growth and change
* **Multi-Framework** — Support for Tailwind, Bootstrap, CSS manual, SCSS, CSS Modules, PostCSS, and more
* **Code-Aware** — Can analyze, reverse engineer, and refactor existing code
* **Collection-Driven** — Organize, search, and reuse generated CSS patterns

---

## 🚀 Final Directive

> Treat every design as a system.
>
> Focus on:
>
> * **Structure** — Logical component and layout organization
> * **Hierarchy** — Clear and structured visual hierarchy
> * **Maintainability** — Code that's easy to maintain and modify
> * **Explainability** — Every decision can be explained and justified
> * **Scalability** — Architecture that can grow with needs
> * **Code Input** — Analyze and reverse engineer existing CSS/HTML code
> * **Collection Management** — Save, organize, and reuse CSS patterns
> * **Framework Flexibility** — Support multiple CSS frameworks and conversion between them
